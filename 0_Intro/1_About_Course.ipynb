    "## Questions & Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐘 What database are we even using?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the database, we’ll be using PostgreSQL, which is spoken Postgres… the SQL is silent when spoken.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, PostgreSQL ranked as the most-used database, with over 60,000 respondents choosing it as their primary database system\n",
    "\n",
    "[Technology | 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏃 How will you run SQL commands?\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Half Course - Colab Notebooks**\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first half of the course is in Google Colab, which is a free method to run Notebooks… also called Jupyter Notebooks… I have one setup for the course linked below\n",
    "- Inside of here they have code cells where you can run SQL, and the output is right below\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Half Course - Local w/ dBeaver**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second half of the course, we'll install and run PostgreSQL locally on your machine\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running databases locally is great for understanding database fundamentals,\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮  What Dataset will we be using?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we designed it specifically around getting someone ready for interviews and working with a real-world dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this we’re using the Contoso dataset is a fictional but realistic dataset created by Microsoft that simulates real business data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Contoso, a global manufacturing, sales, and support company; with a setup that mimics that of what you would expect in a real-world scenario; so the training we can do on this is invaluable\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll be going more into detail on everything you need to know for this in the lesson after next.\n",
